# eSOM - simple and modern Self-Organizing Maps (SOM)

## Description

This app, made with the [ElectronJS Framework][1] was originally a more modern approach for training, using and testing Kohonen Neural Networks or Self-Organizing Maps for use in chem-informatics, but can be used in any relevant context in order to utilize the power of these special networks.

## Tutorial

### Getting Started

[WIP]

### Data

Data must be formatted like in the example files... [WIP]

### Algorythms

This app features **two algorithms** for training SOMs. The traditional one is found anywhere referencing SOMs, but the experimental one was coded by me while trying to over-optimize the traditional one.  
This new algorythm is ***roughly 20x faster*** or close to that. So what the traditional algorythm does in ~300 epochs this one can (and will only) do in ~15 (as if you let it run for too many epochs it gliches producing no significant map). 

## Disclaimer

This app is in an unfinished state. So while the descriptors page works as far as I have tested it there might be bugs within it and the other pages are not done at all (with the exception of the descriptors one which has a start in it's own branch that wil only be merged when in a more "complete" state).
